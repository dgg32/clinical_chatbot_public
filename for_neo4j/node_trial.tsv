Mim8 is a new medicine that is used to prevent bleeding episodes in people with haemophilia A. Mim8 works by replacing the function of the missing clotting factor VIII (FVIII). Mim8 will be injected under the skin using a pen-injector either once every week, once every two weeks or once every month. The participants will be trained in using the pen injector. The participants can choose themselves, in collaboration with the study doctor how often they get Mim8 in this study. When the participant will get their first Mim8 injection depends on their current treatment with emicizumab. The participants will get their first Mim8 injection at Visit 2. Participants will have between 6 and 27 Mim8 injections. The total number of injections participants will have depends on their dosing frequency. The study will last for about 6-12 months.

In Part 1, participants are divided into 4 groups of almost equal size. 3 groups get different doses of spesolimab, 1 group gets placebo.

One group gets a suitable dose of spesolimab that was found in Part 1 of the study. The other group gets placebo. After 4 months, participants in the placebo group switch to spesolimab treatment.  Participants join only one of the two parts. They are in the study for about 1 year. During this time, they visit the study site in the beginning every week and later every 2 weeks. Some of the visits can be done at the participant's home instead of the study site. The doctors regularly check participants' HS symptoms.
